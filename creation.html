        <h3>Creation of Bitcoin</h3>
        <div>The world's first cryptocurrency is called Bitcoin. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, about whom we still don't know much. There is speculation as to whether it was just one individual or a whole group, but nothing has been confirmed yet. On October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published a newspaper article titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Payment System,".in January 2009, Nakamoto released the first Bitcoin software. The initial block of the blockchain, known as the Genesis Block, was mined on January 3, 2009, and included a message referencing a bank bailout, suggesting a critique of the financial system. This started the history of cryptocurrencies. </div>

        <h3>Creation of Ethereum</h3>
        <div>Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 to expand the possibilities of blockchain technology beyond Bitoin. He invented a platform on which "smart contracts" and decentralized applications operate. In 2014, he and his co-founders founded the Ethereum Foundation, where they raised over $18 million through ICOs. Since then, Ethereum has focused on improving security, speed, and functionality.</div>
