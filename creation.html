        <h3>Creation of Bitcoin</h3>
        <div>Bitcoin was created by an individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. In October 2008, Nakamoto published a whitepaper describing Bitcoin as a decentralized digital currency that allows direct online payments without financial institutions. Following this, in January 2009, Nakamoto released the first Bitcoin software. The initial block of the blockchain, known as the Genesis Block, was mined on January 3, 2009, and included a message referencing a bank bailout, suggesting a critique of the financial system. Bitcoin operates using a Proof of Work mechanism, where miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and secure the network.</div>

        <h3>Creation of Ethereum</h3>
        <div>Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 to extend blockchain capabilities beyond Bitcoin. He proposed a platform with a Turing-complete programming language for smart contracts and decentralized applications. In 2014, Buterin and his co-founders formed the Ethereum Foundation and raised over $18 million through an ICO. The first version, Frontier, launched in July 2015, enabling the development of decentralized applications and marking a significant advancement in blockchain technology. Subsequent upgrades have continued to enhance Ethereum's security, scalability, and functionality.</div>
