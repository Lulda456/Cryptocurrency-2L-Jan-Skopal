        <h3>Creation of Bitcoin</h3>
        <div>The first digital currency in the world is Bitcoin, and it was made by Satoshi Nakamoto whose identity we never know much of. The speculation whether it was an individual or a group of people is still ongoing, but nothing has been confirmed yet. On October 31st, 2008 Nakamoto published a newspaper article titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Payment System,".Nakamoto released the first Bitcoin software in January 2009.Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block in the blockchain on January 3, 2009 called the Genesis Block which contained a message alluding to a bank bailout and thus implicitly criticizing the financial system. This began the era of cryptocurrencies. </div>

        <h3>Creation of Ethereum</h3>
        <div>In 2013, Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin, who intended to go beyond Bitcoin with blockchain technology. This is a platform that allows for the operation of “smart contracts” and decentralized applications. In the year 2014, however, he with his co-founders established the Ethereum Foundation through which they were able to raise over $18 million from ICOs. Since then, Ethereum has been focusing on enhancing security, speed as well as functionality.</div>
